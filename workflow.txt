### **📌 Optimized Workflow for Gas Cylinder Tracking System**  

Now that we have the basic button structure, let’s fine-tune the **workflow** to ensure it’s **efficient and easy to use** for both **warehouse workers** and **customers**.

---

## **1️⃣ Cylinder Registration (Initial Setup)**
✅ **Who:** Warehouse Admin  
✅ **What Happens:**  
1. New cylinders are assigned **unique QR codes** (printed and attached).  
2. The system **stores cylinder details**:
   - Cylinder ID  
   - Manufacturing Date  
   - Current Status (**Available for Dispatch**)  
   - Last Refill Date  
3. Admin confirms and **saves all cylinders** in the database.  

📌 **Status Change:** **Cylinder status = Available**  

---

## **2️⃣ Dispatch Cylinders (Sending to Customers)**
✅ **Who:** Warehouse Workers  
✅ **What Happens:**  
1. **Worker scans multiple cylinders** using the phone’s camera.  
2. **System adds all scanned cylinders to a batch.**  
3. **Worker selects the destination company** (XYZ, ABC, etc.).  
4. **Worker confirms shipment.**  

📌 **Status Change:** **Cylinders → "Sent to XYZ Company"**  
📌 **Admin can view:** How many cylinders were sent, when, and to whom.  

🔹 **Edge Case:** If a worker scans a duplicate cylinder (already sent), the system alerts them.  

---

## **3️⃣ Receiving Cylinders at Customer's Location**
✅ **Who:** XYZ Company (Customer)  
✅ **What Happens:**  
1. XYZ staff **scans all received cylinders** with their phone.  
2. The system **matches the scanned IDs** with the shipment records.  
3. If **all cylinders match**, XYZ **confirms receipt**.  
4. If **some cylinders are missing**, XYZ **reports missing cylinders**.  

📌 **Status Change:** **Cylinders → "Received by XYZ Company"**  
📌 **Admin can view:** Which shipments were delivered, pending, or missing cylinders.  

🔹 **Edge Case:** If XYZ doesn’t scan within 24 hours, the system **sends an automatic reminder**.  

---

## **4️⃣ Returning Empty Cylinders**
✅ **Who:** XYZ Company (Customer)  
✅ **What Happens:**  
1. XYZ staff **scans empty cylinders** they want to return.  
2. The system **creates a return shipment record**.  
3. XYZ staff **confirms the return shipment**.  
4. The gas company **receives an alert** that a return is on the way.  

📌 **Status Change:** **Cylinders → "Returning to Gas Company"**  
📌 **Admin can track:** How many cylinders are **pending return** from each company.  

🔹 **Edge Case:** If cylinders aren’t returned after 30 days, the system **sends a penalty alert or reminder**.  

---

## **5️⃣ Receiving Returned Cylinders at the Gas Company**
✅ **Who:** Warehouse Workers  
✅ **What Happens:**  
1. Warehouse staff **scans all returned cylinders**.  
2. System updates records to **"Returned & Ready for Refill."**  
3. Warehouse manager gets notified **when stock is low**.  

📌 **Status Change:** **Cylinders → "Available for Refill."**  
📌 **Admin can track:** Which cylinders have been **successfully returned**.  

🔹 **Edge Case:** If some cylinders are missing, the system marks them as **"Lost or Pending Return."**  

---

## **6️⃣ Refilling Process**
✅ **Who:** Gas Company Staff  
✅ **What Happens:**  
1. Staff **scans returned cylinders** and marks them as "Under Refill."  
2. Once refilled, the system **updates the stock** as "Ready for Dispatch."  
3. Cylinders are now available for the **next shipment cycle.**  

📌 **Status Change:** **Cylinders → "Ready for Dispatch."**  
📌 **Admin can track:** Refill cycles, refill delays, and stock levels.  

🔹 **Edge Case:** If a cylinder **fails quality checks**, it is flagged for **"Maintenance Required."**  

---

## **7️⃣ Admin Dashboard (Tracking & Reports)**
✅ **Who:** Admin & Warehouse Managers  
✅ **What Happens:**  
- Track **all cylinder movements** (sent, received, pending returns, refills).  
- **Filter by customer** (XYZ, ABC) to see their cylinder usage.  
- **View overdue returns** and send reminders.  
- **Generate reports** (monthly shipments, lost cylinders, refill cycles).  

📌 **Key Metrics for Admins:**  
✔ **Total cylinders in circulation**  
✔ **How many cylinders are with each company**  
✔ **Pending returns & overdue shipments**  
✔ **Refill & maintenance tracking**

## **🚀 Next Steps**
Now that our **workflow is optimized**, we can:  
1️⃣ **Finalize navigation flow (how screens connect).**  
2️⃣ **Draft basic wireframes (layout of buttons & screens).**  
3️⃣ **Decide database structure (how data is stored & retrieved).**  

**Do you want to move forward with wireframing now?** 🎯
