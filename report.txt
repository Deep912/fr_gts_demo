### **🔍 Planning the Reports Page for Your Gas Cylinder Tracking System**
Before we start coding, let’s define what **reports** you need. Since your system tracks gas cylinders and companies, the **Reports Page** should provide meaningful insights and logs.

### **📝 What Data Should the Reports Page Show?**
Here are some key reports that would be useful:

#### **1️⃣ Cylinder Movement Report**
   - **Tracks when and where cylinders were sent/received.**
   - **Fields:**  
     ✅ Serial Number  
     ✅ Gas Type  
     ✅ Size  
     ✅ Status Change (Empty → Refilling, Refilling → Available, etc.)  
     ✅ Sent From (Company/Worker Name)  
     ✅ Received By (Company/Worker Name)  
     ✅ Date & Time  

#### **2️⃣ Cylinder Stock Report**
   - **Shows how many cylinders are available, dispatched, or being refilled.**
   - **Fields:**  
     ✅ Gas Type  
     ✅ Size  
     ✅ Total Available  
     ✅ Total Dispatched  
     ✅ Total in Refilling  
     ✅ Last Updated  

#### **3️⃣ Company Transaction Report**
   - **Tracks how many cylinders a company has received/sent over time.**
   - **Fields:**  
     ✅ Company Name  
     ✅ Total Cylinders Received  
     ✅ Total Cylinders Sent  
     ✅ Last Transaction Date  

#### **4️⃣ Worker Activity Report**
   - **Tracks which workers are handling cylinder transactions.**
   - **Fields:**  
     ✅ Worker Name  
     ✅ Total Cylinders Processed  
     ✅ Actions (Send, Receive, Refill, etc.)  
     ✅ Date of Last Activity  

#### **5️⃣ Deleted Cylinders & Restored Records**
   - **Tracks which cylinders were deleted or restored.**
   - **Fields:**  
     ✅ Serial Number

     ✅ Deleted By (Admin Name)  
     ✅ Restored By (Admin Name)  
     ✅ Date of Deletion  
     ✅ Date of Restoration

### **📊 Features for the Reports Page**
1. **Date Range Filter** – Filter reports by specific time periods.  
2. **Export as CSV/PDF** – Allow users to download reports.  
3. **Search & Sorting** – Search by serial number, gas type, company name, or worker name.  
4. **Graphical Charts (Optional)** – Show cylinder trends over time.

### **🚀 Next Steps**
✅ **Confirm which reports you want.**  
✅ **Decide if we need charts (or just tables).**  
✅ **Choose filters (by date, company, worker, etc.).**
